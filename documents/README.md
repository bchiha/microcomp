# Microcomp Documents

Here is a list of documents relating to the Microcomp.  Everything you need to know is here.  It is an important resource for people who build the Microcomp.  The documents are:

* __microcomp_lower_rom_listing.pdf__ - Original lower ROM listing annotation compiled by me.
* __microcomp_publication.pdf__ - Microcomp publication from Talking Electronics Issues 13 and 14.  Go here to read about how it works and what programs are on the lower ROM.
* __microcomp_publication_part3.pdf__ - The final part of the Microcomp that explains any missing programs not included in the original publication and the Noughts and Crosses Add-On in detail.
* __microcomp_theory.pdf__ - Additional design theory on the Microcomp and Z80 basics.
* __fm_bugs.pdf__ - The FM Bugs magazine that got Colin in a bit of trouble!
