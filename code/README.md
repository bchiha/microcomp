# Microcomp Code

This folder contains the source code in the Z80 assembly for the upper ROM.  Have a look at the individual programs to see how they work.  `microcomp_upper_rom.z80` contains the combined upper ROM code, but the individual code is also here with more comments.  Included is the menu driver that I wrote which removes the need to use the _dip switch_ to select the programs.
